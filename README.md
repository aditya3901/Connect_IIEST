Click on { app-debug.apk --> View raw } to download the app.
I'd made this one just to practice various components that I was learing every now and then. 
Some main features of this app are : 

  (a) User Authentication using Firebase Auth
  (b) Tabbed Layout (just like Whatsapp ;) )
  (c) Memes Fragment to enjoy some funny memes. (Reddit's Meme API --> Android Volley)
  (d) Blog Fragment to read latest programming related blogs. (WebView + WebView Controller)
  (e) Users List with search option to find your friends. (RecyclerView + FirebaseAuth + FirebaseDB)
  (f) User's Profile Page 
  
Thank You All :)
